# Aseprite Extensions

Aseprite is a Pixel Art Tool and Animated Sprite Editor - if you are not familiar with it you can find out more on the [official Aseprite website](https://www.aseprite.org/)

Aseprite extensions are usually small lua script based additions to the base program, meant to bring additional functionality not available out of the box. You can read more about extensions on official [Aseprite Docs](https://www.aseprite.org/docs/extensions/)

## How to install an Aseprite Extension
First download the `tile-index-overlay.aseprite-extension` file from the Github Releases, next:
* EITHER > double-click the `tile-index-overlay.aseprite-extension` file - this will open Aseprite and ask if you want to install the extension
* OR > in Aseprite go to `Edit > Preferences > Extensions` and click on the "Add Extension" button, navigate and select the `tile-index-overlay.aseprite-extension` to install it

In both cases the extension will be installed in your [configuration directory](https://www.aseprite.org/docs/preferences-folder/) inside the extensions subfolder.
