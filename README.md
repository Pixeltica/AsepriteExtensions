# Tile Index Overlay Extension | Summary

The Tile Index Overlay extension creates a new layer(s) on your currently open sprite. Based on user defied tile size (width and height) it will place a 4 digit index number in the upper left corner of each tile. This index number "map" is meant to assist in quickly finding the position of sprites/tiles without having to check their coordinates individually.

Use Cases:
* locating existing textures in large spritesheets/tilesheets (SDV modding community will be familiar with the challange of springobjects!)
* noting tile index numbers needed for object placement code
* debugging objects displaying incorrect textures - loading spritesheets/tilesheets with the index map visible will quickly help identify which tile numbers may not be displaying intended textures
